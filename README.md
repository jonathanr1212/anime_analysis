# Anime List Analysis Using Python, GraphQL and Tableau
![](images/anime_background5.jpg)

## Motivation
This project represents an in-depth analysis of my personal anime preferences. My objective was to leverage an API for querying, clean the obtained data, and transform it into actionable insights to address various inquiries I had. Key questions guiding this analysis included:

- <b>What is the total count of series/episodes I've watched?</b>
- <b>Which genres are the most/least frequently watched?</b>
- <b>What are the average scores I've assigned to anime?</b>
- <b>How do my scores compare with the ratings provided by the broader community?</b>

## Background
As a long-time anime enthusiast, I meticulously maintain a record of my favorite anime series on the platform www.anilist.co. Should you wish to explore my profile further, you can find it at [this link](https://anilist.co/user/tetsu1290/animelist).

This practice has sparked my curiosity regarding the alignment between my perceived anime preferences and the data I've accumulated over the years. It's important to note that my anime tastes have evolved over time. All ratings provided reflect my opinion at the moment I completed watching each anime. Ratings assigned a decade ago, for instance, may not necessarily reflect my current sentiments. Various factors, such as the release of new anime, advancements in animation quality, and shifts in personal preferences, contribute to this fluidity in my ratings.
